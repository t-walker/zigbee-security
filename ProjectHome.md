Project homepage for the ZigBee/802.15.4 security research at the Dartmouth Trust Lab, which is under the umbrella project name of **Api-do**.

## Overview ##

The goal is to produce methods and tools for accessing security of ZigBee and other IEEE 802.15.4 deployments and/or implementations. Specifically, we seek to advance the state-of-the-art in device discovery and enumeration, geographical mapping, fingerprinting, and exploitation, while providing recommendations for remediation.

Api-do is a collection of tools inspired by and extending Joshua Wright's original KillerBee. It is a martial art aspect of ZigBee networking [apiculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping): the Way of the Bee.

“Security will not get better until tools for practical exploration of the attack surface are made available.” _("Wright's law", [Joshua Wright](http://www.willhackforsushi.com/))_

“It is hard to overemphasize the importance of penetration testing in the overall information security structure and the value of viewing your network through the cracker's eyes prior to further hardening procedures” _(Wi-Foo: The Secrets of Wireless Hacking, 20)_
